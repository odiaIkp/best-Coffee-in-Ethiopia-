# best-Coffee-in-Ethiopia-
As a lover of coffee I wanted to find out the best quality of coffee in terms of flavour and Taste in Ethiopia so I looked for a dataset to help me with mv research. I got a coffee quality dataset and the database was scrapped from Coffee Quality Institute in the year 2018. Firstlv. L had to clean the dataset bv finding the number of duplicates and removing the duplicates. Secondly, I changed the column name processing_method to creation to make it shorter. Thirdly, I filtered the dataset to have only country Ethiopia, fourthly, I added the column Flavor and Aftertaste to get the best_quality. Lastly, I looked for the number greater than 17 and the best quality coffee in Ethiopia is specie Arabica, owner metad plc, region Oromiya, best quality number 17.25
